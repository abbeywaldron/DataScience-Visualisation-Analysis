\section{General description}

In this course you will learn about one of the most important skills of the data scientist: data visualisation.  We will focus on using visualisation to understand problems and clearly explain your research to others.  We will also be applying statistics and machine learning algorithms that you will learn in other parts of the course to conduct a number of small analysis projects.

\subsection{Relationship with other teaching units}

This course will rely heavily on material learned in the statistics module.
